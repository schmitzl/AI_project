# A survey on classifiers for sentiment classification of song lyrics

This project has been created for the course <a href="https://www.kth.se/social/course/DD2380/">Artificial Intelligence</a>.

We explored the potential accuracy of the analysis of song lyrics. 
Datasets with various labels were tested for their ability to categorize lyrics as emitting a certain mood. 
The focus lies on the comparison of different categorisations and classifiers. 
The identification of emotions in lyrics is a problem which has no satisfactory solution yet 
due to the ambiguous and subjective nature of lyrics.
