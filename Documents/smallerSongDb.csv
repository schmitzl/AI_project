And what'll you do now My darling young one?  I'm a-goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a-fallin' I'll walk to the depths of the deepest dark forest Where the people are many and their hands are all empty Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters Where their home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison And the executioner's face is always well-hidden  Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten Where black is the color, where none is the number And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it And reflect from the mountains so all souls can see it And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin' But I'll know my song well before I start singing  And it's a hard, it's a hard It's a hard, and it's a hard It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall;Bob Dylan;A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall
