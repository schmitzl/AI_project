Distant ships sailing into the mist, You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing.  Freedom just around the corner for you But with truth so far off, what good will it do?  Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune, Bird fly high by the light of the moon, Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.  So swiftly the sun sets in the sky, You rise up and say goodbye to no one. Fools rush in where angels fear to tread, Both of their futures, so full of dread, you don't show one. Shedding off one more layer of skin, Keeping one step ahead of the persecutor within.  Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune, Bird fly high by the light of the moon, Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.  You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds, Manipulator of crowds, you're a dream twister. You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah But what do you care? Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister. Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame, You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name.  Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune, Bird fly high by the light of the moon, Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.  Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy, The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers. In the smoke of the twilight on a milk-white steed, Michelangelo indeed could've carved out your features. Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space, Half asleep neath the stars with a small dog licking your face.  Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune, Bird fly high by the light of the moon, Oh. oh. oh. Jokerman.  Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame, Preacherman seeks the same, who'll get there first is uncertain. Nightsticks and water cannons, tear gas, padlocks, Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain, False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin, Only a matter of time 'til night comes steppin' in.  Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune, Bird fly high by the light of the moon, Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.  It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray, A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet. He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat, Take the motherless children off the street And place them at the feet of a harlot. Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants, Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response.

austere;The rain falls down on last year's man, That's a jew's harp on the table, That's a crayon in his hand. And the corners of the blueprint are ruined since they rolled Far past the stems of thumbtacks That still throw shadows on the wood. And the skylight is like skin for a drum I'll never mend And all the rain falls down amen On the works of last year's man.  I met a lady, she was playing with her soldiers in the dark Oh one by one she had to tell them That her name was Joan of Arc. I was in that army, yes I stayed a little while I want to thank you, Joan of Arc, For treating me so well.  And though I wear a uniform I was not born to fight All these wounded boys you lie beside, Goodnight, my friends, goodnight.  I came upon a wedding that old families had contrived Bethlehem the bridegroom, Babylon the bride. Great Babylon was naked, oh she stood there trembling for me, And Bethlehem inflamed us both Like the shy one at some orgy. And when we fell together all our flesh was like a veil That I had to draw aside to see The serpent eat its tail.  Some women wait for Jesus, and some women wait for Cain So I hang upon my altar And I hoist my axe again. And I take the one who finds me back to where it all began When Jesus was the honeymoon And Cain was just the man. And we read from pleasant Bibles that are bound in blood and skin That the wilderness is gathering All its children back again.  The rain falls down on last year's man, An hour has gone by And he has not moved his hand. But everything will happen if he only gives the word The lovers will rise up And the mountains touch the ground. But the skylight is like skin for a drum I'll never mend And all the rain falls down amen On the works of last year's man.;Leonard Cohen;Last Year's Man

'Twas then he felt alone And wished that he'd gone straight And watched out for a simple twist of fate.  They walked alone by the old canal. A little confused, I remember well, And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright. He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train Moving with a simple twist of fate.  A saxophone someplace far off played As she was walking on by the arcade As the light bust through a beat up shade Where he was waking up. She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate And forgot about a simple twist of fate.  He woke up the room was bare. He didn't see her anywhere. He told himself he didn't care pushed the window open wide Felt an emptiness inside to which he just could not relate Brought on by a simple twist of fate.  He hears the ticking of the clocks And walks along with a parrot that talks. Hunts her down by the waterfront docks Where the sailors all come in. Maybe she'll pick him out again. How long must he wait One more time for a simple twist of fate.  People tell me it's a sin To know and feel too much within. I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring. She was born in spring, but I was born too late. Blame it on a simple twist of fate.;Bob Dylan;Simple Twist of Fate

Love is now the stardust of yesterday, the music of the years gone by. Chorus Sometimes I wonder why I spend the lonely night dreaming of a song. The melody haunts my reverie, and I am once again with you, when our love was new, and each kiss an inspiration. But that was long ago, now my consolation is in the stardust of a song. Beside a garden wall, when stars are bright,  you are in my arms. the nightingale tells his fairy tale a paradise where roses bloom. Though I dream in vain, in my heart it will remain: My stardust melody, the memory of love's refrain Repeat Chorus;Frank Sinatra;Stardust
bittersweet,literate,melancholy,reflective,wistful,yearning;Early one morning, the sun was shining I was laying in bed Wondering if she'd changed it all If her hair was still red Her folks, they said our lives together Sure was gonna be rough They never did like mama's homemade dress Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough And I was standing on the side of the road Rain falling on my shoes Heading out for the east coast Lord knows I've paid some dues getting through Tangled up in blue  She was married when we first met Soon to be divorced I helped her out of a jam, I guess But I used a little too much force We drove that car as far as we could Abandoned it out west Split up on a dark, sad night Both agreeing it was best She turned around to look at me As I was walking away I heard her say over my shoulder "We'll meet again someday on the avenue" Tangled up in blue  I had a job in the great north woods Working as a cook for a spell But I never did like it all that much And one day the axe just fell So I drifted down to New Orleans Where I's lucky for to be employed Working for a while on a fishing boat Right outside of Delacroix But all the while I was alone The past was close behind I seen a lot of women But she never escaped my mind and I just grew Tangled up in blue  She was working in a topless place And I stopped in for a beer I just kept looking at the sight of her face In the spotlight so clear And later on when the crowd thinned out I's just about to do the same She was standing there in back of my chair Said, "Tell me, don't I know your name?" I muttered something underneath my breath She studied the lines on my face I must admit I felt a little uneasy When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe Tangled up in blue  She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe "I thought you'd never say hello," she said "You look like the silent type" Then she opened up a book of poems And handed it to me Written by an Italian poet From the thirteenth century And every one of them words rang true And glowed like burning coal Pouring off of every page Like it was written in my soul from me to you Tangled up in blue  I lived with them on Montague Street In a basement down the stairs There was music in the cafés at night And revolution in the air Then he started into dealing with slaves And something inside of him died She had to sell everything she owned And froze up inside And when finally the bottom fell out I became withdrawn The only thing I knew how to do Was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew Tangled up in blue  So now I'm going back again I got to get her somehow All the people we used to know They're an illusion to me now Some are mathematicians Some are carpenter's wives Don't know how it all got started I don't what they do with their lives But me, I'm still on the road Heading for another joint We always did feel the same We just saw it from a different point of view Tangled up in blue;Bob Dylan;Tangled Up in Blue
bittersweet,gentle,intimate,literate,melancholy,plaintive,reflective,soft-quiet,wistful,yearning;'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood When blackness was a virtue the road was full of mud I came in from the wilderness, a creature void of form "Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm"  And if I pass this way again, you can rest assured I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word In a world of steel-eyed death, and men who are fighting to be warm. "Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm"  Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved Everything up to that point had been left unresolved Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm "Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm"  I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail Poisoned in the bushes an' blown out on the trail Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn "Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm"  Suddenly I turned around and she was standin' there With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns "Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm"  Now there's a wall between us, somethin' there's been lost I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed Just to think that it all began on an noneventful morn "Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm"  Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn "Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm"  I've heard newborn babies wailin' like a mournin' dove And old men with broken teeth stranded without love Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn? "Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm"  In a little hilltop village, they gambled for my clothes I bargained for salvation an' she gave me a lethal dose I offered up my innocence and got repaid with scorn "Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm"  Well, I'm livin' in a foreign country but I'm bound to cross the line Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born "Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm";Bob Dylan;Shelter from the Storm

It's so hard to get on And these visions of Johanna They've kept me up past the dawn  Inside the museums, infinity goes up on trial Voices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while But Mona Lisa must have had the highway blues You can tell by the way she smiles  See the primitive wallflower freeze When the jelly-faced women all sneeze Hear the one with the mustache say "Jeez, I can't find my knees"  Both jewels and binoculars Hang from the head of the mule But these visions of Johanna They make it all seem so cruel  The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him" But like Louise always says "You can't look at much, can you man?" as she herself prepares for him  My Madonna, she still has not showed We see this empty cage now corrode Where her cape of the stage once had flowed The fiddler, he now steps to the road He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed" On the back of the fish truck that loads While my conscience explodes  The harmonicas play The skeleton keys and the rain And these visions of Johanna Are now all that remain;Bob Dylan;Visions of Johanna

She goes away for a minute and I slide out out of my chair I step outside back to the busy street, but nobody's going anywhere  Well my heart's in the Highlands, with the horses and hounds Way up in the border country, far from the towns With the twang of the arrow and a snap of the bow My heart's in the Highlands Can't see any other way to go  Every day is the same thing out the door Feel further away then ever before Some things in life, it gets too late to learn Well, I'm lost somewhere I must have made a few bad turns  I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright colored clothes All the young men with their young women looking so good Well, I'd trade places with any of 'em In a minute, if I could  I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog Talking to myself in a monologue I think what I need might be a full length leather coat Somebody just asked me If I'm registered to vote  The sun is beginning to shine on me But it's not like the sun that used to be The party's over and there's less and less to say I got new eyes Everything looks far away  Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day Over the hills and far away There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow But I'm already there in my mind And that's good enough for now;Bob Dylan;Highlands
bleak,eerie,gloomy,ominous,weary;I'm walking through streets that are dead Walking, walking with you in my head My feet are so tired, my brain is so wired And the clouds are weeping  Did I hear someone tell a lie? Did I hear someone's distant cry? I spoke like a child, you destroyed me with a smile While I was sleeping  I'm sick of love But I'm in the thick of it This kind of love I'm so sick of it  I see, I see lovers in the meadow I see, I see silhouettes in the window I watch them till they're gone and they leave me hanging on To a shadow  I'm sick of love I hear the clock tick This kind of love I'm love sick  Sometimes the silence can be like the thunder Sometimes I wanna take to the road and plunder Could you ever be true? I think of you And I wonder  I'm sick of love I wish I'd never met you I'm sick of love I'm trying to forget you  Just don't know what to do I'd give anything to Be with you;Bob Dylan;Love Sick

brassy,elaborate;Granada, I'm falling under your spell, And if you could speak, what a fascinating tale you would tell. Of an age the world has long forgotten, Of an age that weaves a silent magic in Granada today. The dawn in the sky greets the day with a sigh for Granada. For she can remember the splendor that once was Granada. It still can be found in the hills all around as I wander along, Entranced by the beauty before me, Entranced by a land full of flowers and song. When day is done and the sun touch the sea in Granada, I envy the blush of the snow-clad Tierra Novada, Soon it will welcome the stars While a thousand guitars play a soft Carbinera. Then moonlit Granada will live again, The glory of yesterday, romantic and gay. (musical interlude) And soon it will welcome the stars While a thousand guitars play a soft Carbinera. Then moonlit Granada will live again, The glory of yesterday, romantic, gay Granada.  And these are the Spanish lyrics as sung by Placido Domingo:  Granada, tierra soñada por mi Mi cantar se vuelve gitano cuando es para ti Mi cantar, hecho de fantasia Mi cantar, flor de melancolia Que yo te vengo a dar  Granada, Manola cantada en coplas preciosas No tengo otra cosa que darte que un ramo de rosas De sueño rebelde y gitano cubierta de flores Y beso tu boca de grana jugosa manzana Que me habla de amores  Granada, tierra ensangrentada en tardes de toros Mujer que conserva el embrujo de tus ojos moros De rosas de suave fragancia Que le dieran marco a la Virgen morena  Granada, tu tierra esta llena De lindas mujeres, de sangre y de sol  De rosas de suave fragancia Que le dieran marco a la Virgen morena Granada, tu tierra esta llena De lindas mujeres, de sangre y de sol;Frank Sinatra;Granada

I woke up on the roadside, daydreamin' 'bout the way things sometimes are Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are makin' me see stars. You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies. One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzin' around your eyes, Blood on your saddle.  Idiot wind, blowing through the flowers on your tomb, Blowing through the curtains in your room. Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth, You're an idiot, babe. It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.  It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart You tamed the lion in my cage but it just wasn't enough to change my heart. Now everything's a little upside down, as a matter of fact the wheels have stopped, What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top You're on the bottom.  I noticed at the ceremony, your corrupt ways had finally made you blind I can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes don't look into mine. The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned. I waited for you on the running boards, near the cypress trees, while the springtime turned  Slowly into autumn.  Idiot wind, blowing like a circle around my skull, From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol. Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth, You're an idiot, babe. It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.  I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishin' I been somebody else instead. Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy, I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory And all your ragin' glory.  I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free, I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me. You'll never know the hurt I suffered nor the pain I rise above, And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness or your kind of love, And it makes me feel so sorry.  Idiot wind, blowing through the buttons of our coats, Blowing through the letters that we wrote. Idiot wind, blowing through the dust upon our shelves, We're idiots, babe. It's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.;Bob Dylan;Idiot Wind
brooding,delicate,sad;If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier She left here last early spring, is livin' there, I hear Say for me that I'm all right though things get kind of slow She might think that I've forgotten her, don't tell her it isn't so.  We had a falling-out, like lovers often will And to think of how she left that night, it still brings me a chill And though our separation, it pierced me to the heart She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart.  If you get close to her, kiss her once for me I always have respected her for doing what she did and gettin' free Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way Though the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay.  I see a lot of people as I make the rounds And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm gettin' soft.  Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast If she's passin' back this way, I'm not that hard to find Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time.;Bob Dylan;If You See Her, Say Hello
brooding;Know a man His face seems pulled and tense Like he's riding on a motorbike In the strongest winds  So I approach with tact Suggest that he should relax But he's always moving Much too fast  Said he'll see me on the flip side On this trip he's taking for a ride He's been taking too much on There he goes with his perfectly unkempt clothes  There he goes...  He's yet to come back But I've seen his picture It doesn't look the same Up on the rack  We go way back  I wonder about his insides It's like his thoughts are too big for his size He's been taken Where I don't know Off he goes with his perfectly unkempt clothes  There he goes  And now I rub my eyes For he has returned Seems my preconceptions are what should have been burned For he still smiles And he's still strong  Nothing's changed but the surrounding bullshit That has grown  And now he's home And we're laughing like we always did My same old Same old friend  Until a quarter-to-ten I saw the strain creep in He seems distracted And I know just what is going to happen then  Before his first step He is off again;Pearl Jam;Off He Goes
brooding;I shut and locked the front door No way in or out I turned and walked the hallway And pulled the curtains down I knelt and emptied the mouth of every plug around But nothing's sound, nothing's sound  I stayed where my last cap left me Ignored all my rounds Soon I was seeing visions and cracks along the walls They're upside down  I swallow my words to keep from lying I swallow my face just to keep from biting, I, I..

brooding,earnest,reflective,sentimental,wistful,yearning;I wish I was a neutron bomb, for once I could go off I wish I was a sacrifice, but somehow still lived on I wish I was a sentimental ornament you hung on The Christmas tree, I wish I was the star that went on top I wish I was the evidence, I wish I was the grounds For 50 million hands upraised and open toward the sky  I wish I was a sailor with someone who waited for me I wish I was as fortunate, as fortunate as me I wish I was a messenger and all the news was good I wish I was the full moon shining off your Camaro's hood  I wish I was an alien at home behind the sun I wish I was the souvenir you kept your house key on I wish I was the pedal brake that you depended on I wish I was the verb 'to trust' and never let you down  I wish I was a radio song, the one that you turned up I wish...

brooding,earnest,reflective,sentimental,wistful,yearning;He could have tuned in, tuned in, but he tuned out A bad time, nothing could save him Alone in a corridor waiting locked out He got up out of there, ran for hundreds of miles He made it to the ocean, had a smoke in a tree The wind rose up, set him down on his knee Wave came crashing like a fist to the jaw, Delivered him wings, "Hey, look at me now..." Arms wide open with the sea as his floor Oh – ah, ohhh...  He's - flying! Home High! Wide! Home...  He floated back down 'cause he wanted to share His key to the locks on the chains, he saw everywhere But first he was stripped, then he was stabbed By faceless men, well...fuckers, he still stands. And he still gives his love, he just gives it away The love he receives is the love that is saved And sometimes is seen a strange spot in the sky A human being that was given to fly  Flying! Home... High! Flying! Home... He's Flying! Home... Ohh, oahh...Home...;Pearl Jam;Given to Fly

circular;Really don't mind if you sit this one out. My words but a whisper -- your deafness a SHOUT. I may make you feel but I can't make you think. Your sperm's in the gutter -- your love's in the sink.  So you ride yourselves over the fields and You make all your animal deals and Your wise men don't know how it feels To be thick as a brick.  And the sand-castle virtues are all swept away In the tidal destruction the moral melee. The elastic retreat rings the close of play As the last wave uncovers the newfangled way.  But your new shoes are worn at the heels And your suntan does rapidly peel And your wise men don't know how it feels To be thick as a brick.  And the love that I feel is so far away: I'm a bad dream that I just had today -- And you shake your head And say it's a shame.  Spin me back down the years and the days of my youth. Draw the lace and black curtains and shut out the whole truth. Spin me down the long ages: let them sing the song.  See there!  A son is born -- And we pronounce him fit to fight. There are black-heads on his shoulders, And he pees himself in the night. We'll make a man of him Put him to trade Teach him to play Monopoly And not to sing in the rain.  The Poet and the painter casting shadows on the water -- As the sun plays on the infantry returning from the sea. The do-er and the thinker: no allowance for the other -- As the failing light illuminates the mercenary's creed. The home fire burning: the kettle almost boiling -- But the master of the house is far away. The horses stamping -- their warm breath clouding In the sharp and frosty morning of the day. And the poet lifts his pen while the soldier sheaths his sword.  And the youngest of the family Is moving with authority. Building castles by the sea, He dares the tardy tide To wash them all aside.  The cattle quietly grazing at the grass down by the river Where the swelling mountain water moves onward to the sea: The builder of the castles renews the age-old purpose And contemplates the milking girl whose offer is his need. The young men of the household have all gone into service And are not to be expected for a year. The innocent young master -- thoughts moving ever faster -- Has formed the plan to change the man he seems. And the poet sheaths his pen while the soldier lifts his sword.  And the oldest of the family Is moving with authority. Coming from across the sea, He challenges the son Who puts him to the run.  What do you do when the old man's gone -- Do you want to be him? And your real self sings the song. Do you want to free him? No one to help you get up steam -- And the whirlpool turns you 'way off-beam.  LATER. I've come down from the upper class To mend your rotten ways. My father was a man-of-power Whom everyone obeyed. So come on all you criminals! I've got to put you straight Just like I did with my old man -- Twenty years too late. Your bread and water's going cold. Your hair is too short and neat. I'll judge you all and make damn sure That no-one judges me.  You curl your toes in fun as you smile at everyone -- You meet the stares. You're unaware that your doings aren't done. And you laugh most ruthlessly as you tell us what not to be. But how are we supposed to see where we should run?  I see you shuffle in the courtroom with your rings upon your fingers And your downy little sidies and your silver-buckle shoes. Playing at the hard case, you follow the example Of the comic-paper idol who lets you bend the rules.  So! Come on ye childhood heroes! Won't you rise up from the pages Of your comic-books your super crooks And show us all the way. Well! Make your will and testament. Won't you? Join your local government. We'll have Superman for president Let Robin save the day.  You put your bet on number one and it comes up every time. The other kids have all backed down and they put you first in line. And so you finally ask yourself just how big you are -- And take your place in a wiser world of bigger motor cars. And you wonder who to call on.  So!  Where the hell was Biggles when you needed him last Saturday? And where were all the sportsmen who always pulled you though? They're all resting down in Cornwall -- Writing up their memoirs for a paper-back edition of the Boy Scout Manual.  LATER. See there!  A man born -- And we pronounce him fit for peace. There's a load lifted from his shoulders With the discovery of his disease. We'll take the child from him Put it to the test Teach it to be a wise man How to fool the rest.  QUOTE We will be geared to the average rather than the exceptional God is an overwhelming responsibility We walked through the maternity ward and saw 218 babies wearing nylons It says here that cats are on the upgrade Upgrade?  Hipgrave.  Oh, Mac.  LATER In the clear white circles of morning wonder, I take my place with the lord of the hills. And the blue-eyed soldiers stand slightly discoloured (in neat little rows) Sporting canvas frills. With their jock-straps pinching, they slouch to attention, While queueing for sarnies at the office canteen. Saying -- how's your granny and good old Ernie: He coughed up a tenner on a premium bond win.  The legends (worded in the ancient tribal hymn) lie cradled in the seagull's call. And all the promises they made are ground beneath the sadist's fall. The poet and the wise man stand behind the gun, And signal for the crack of dawn. Light the sun.  Do you believe in the day? Do you? Believe in the day! The Dawn Creation of the Kings has begun. Soft Venus (lonely maiden) brings the ageless one.  Do you believe in the day? Do you? Believe in the day! The fading hero has returned to the night -- And fully pregnant with the day, wise men endorse the poet's sight. Do you believe in the day? Do you? Believe in the day!  Let me tell you the tales of your life Of your love and the cut of the knife The tireless oppression the wisdom instilled The desire to kill or be killed. Let me sing of the losers who lie In the street as the last bus goes by. The pavements are empty: the gutters run red -- While the fool toasts his god in the sky.  So come all ye young men who are building castles! Kindly state the time of the year And join your voices in a hellish chorus. Mark the precise nature of your fear.  Let me help you pick up your dead As the sins of the father are fed With the blood of the fools and the thoughts of the wise And from the pan under your bed. Let me make you a present of song as The wise man breaks wind and is gone while The fool with the hour-glass is cooking his goose and The nursery rhyme winds along.  So! Come all ye young men who are building castles! Kindly state the time of the year And join your voices in a hellish chorus. Mark the precise nature of your fear. See! The summer lightning casts its bolts upon you And the hour of judgement draweth near. Would you be the fool stood in his suit of armour Or the wiser man who rushes clear.  So! Come on ye childhood heroes! Won't your rise up from the pages Of your comic-books your super-crooks And show us all the way. Well!  Make your will and testament. Won't you? Join your local government. We'll have Superman for president Let Robin save the day.  So! Where the hell was Biggles when you needed him last Saturday? And where were all the sportsmen who always pulled you through? They're all resting down in Cornwall -- writing up their memoirs For a paper-back edition of the Boy Scout Manual.  OF COURSE So you ride yourselves over the fields And you make all your animal deals And your wise men don't know how it feels To be thick as a brick.;Jethro Tull;Thick as a Brick
circular,difficult,eccentric;Let me bring you songs from the wood: To make you feel much better than you could know. Dust you down from tip to toe. Show you how the garden grows. Hold you steady as you go. Join the chorus if you can: It'll make of you an honest man. Let me bring you love from the fields: Poppies red and roses filled with summer rain. To heal the wound and still the pain That threatens again and again As you drag down every lover's lane. Life's long celebration's here. I'll toast you all in penny cheer. Let me bring you all things refined: Galliards and lute songs served in chilling ale. Greetings well met fellow, hail! I am the wind to fill your sail. I am the cross to take your nail: A singer of these ageless times. With kitchen prose and gutter rhymes. Songs from the wood make you feel much better.;Jethro Tull;Songs from the Wood

difficult;Bored of the life in the city of gold He'd left and let nobody know. Gone were the towers he had known from a child, Alone with the dream of a life He travelled the wide open road, The blinkered arcade, In search of another to share in his life. Nowhere. Everyone looked so strange to him.  They've got no horns and they've got no tail They don't even know of our existence. Am I wrong to believe in a city of gold That lies in the deep distance, he cried  And wept as they led him away to a cage Beast that can talk, read the sign. The creatures they pushed and they prodded his frame And questioned his story again. But soon they grew bored of their prey The beast that can talk? More like a freak or publicity stunt. Oh No.  They've got no horns and they've got no tail They don't even know of our existence. Am I wrong to believe in a city of gold That lies in the deep distance, he cried  And broke down the door of the cage and marched on out. He grabbed a creature by the scruff of his neck, pointing out: There, beyond the bounds of your weak imagination Lie the noble towers of my city, bright and gold. Let me take you there, show you a living story Let me show you others such as me Why did I ever leave?  They've got no horns and they've got no tail They don't even know of our existence Am I wrong to believe in a city of gold That lies in the deep distance, he cried And wept.  And so we set out with the beast and his horns And his crazy description of home. After many days journey we came to a peak Where the beast gazed abroad and cried out. We followed his gaze and we thought that maybe we saw A spire of gold - no, a trick of the eye that's all, But the beast was gone and a voice was heard:  They've got no horns and they've got no tail They don't even know of our existence Am I wrong to believe in a city of gold That lies in the deep distance  Hello friend, welcome home.;Genesis;A Trick of the Tail

Now I love your eyes – see how the time flies She's learning to hate, but it's just too late for me It was the same with her love It just wasn't enough for me But before this feeling dies Remember how distance can tell lies!  You can almost see her eyes, is it me she despises or you? You're awfully nice to me and I'm sure you can see what her game is She sees you in her place, just as if it's a race And you're winning, and you're winning She just can't understand that for me everything's just beginning Until I get more homesick So before this feeling dies, remember how distance tells us lies…  Singing a song in the morning Singing it again at night Don't really know what I'm singing about But it makes me feel all right;Soft Machine;Moon in June

On the shore lay Montezuma With his coca leaves and pearls In his halls he often wandered With the secrets of the worlds.

And the women all were beautiful And the men stood straight and strong They offered life in sacrifice So that others could go on.  Hate was just a legend And war was never known The people worked together And they lifted many stones.

eerie,hypnotic,spooky,tense-anxious;Pistol shots ring out in the barroom night Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall. She sees the bartender in a pool of blood, Cries out, "My God, they've killed them all!" Here comes the story of the Hurricane, The man the authorities came to blame For somethin' that he never done. Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been The champion of the world.  Three bodies lyin' there does Patty see And another man named Bello, movin' around mysteriously. "I didn't do it," he says, and he throws up his hands "I was only robbin' the register, I hope you understand. I saw them leavin'," he says, and he stops "One of us had better call up the cops." And so Patty calls the cops And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashin' In the hot New Jersey night.  Meanwhile, far away in another part of town Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin' around. Number one contender for the middleweight crown Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road Just like the time before and the time before that. In Paterson that's just the way things go. If you're black you might as well not show up on the street 'Less you wanna draw the heat.  Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops. Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowlin' around He said, "I saw two men runnin' out, they looked like middleweights They jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates." And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head. Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead" So they took him to the infirmary And though this man could hardly see They told him that he could identify the guilty men.  Four in the mornin' and they haul Rubin in, Take him to the hospital and they bring him upstairs. The wounded man looks up through his one dyin' eye Says, "Wha'd you bring him in here for? He ain't the guy!" Yes, here's the story of the Hurricane, The man the authorities came to blame For somethin' that he never done. Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been The champion of the world.  Four months later, the ghettos are in flame, Rubin's in South America, fightin' for his name While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game And the cops are puttin' the screws to him, lookin' for somebody to blame. "Remember that murder that happened in a bar? Remember you said you saw the getaway car? You think you'd like to play ball with the law? Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw runnin' that night? Don't forget that you are white."  Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure." Cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break We got you for the motel job and we're talkin' to your friend Bello Now you don't wanta have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow. You'll be doin' society a favor. That sonofabitch is brave and gettin' braver. We want to put his ass in stir We want to pin this triple murder on him He ain't no Gentleman Jim."  Rubin could take a man out with just one punch But he never did like to talk about it all that much. It's my work, he'd say, and I do it for pay And when it's over I'd just as soon go on my way Up to some paradise Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice And ride a horse along a trail. But then they took him to the jail house Where they try to turn a man into a mouse.  All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance. The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger. No one doubted that he pulled the trigger. And though they could not produce the gun, The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed And the all-white jury agreed.  Rubin Carter was falsely tried. The crime was murder one, guess who testified? Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied And the newspapers, they all went along for the ride. How can the life of such a man Be in the palm of some fool's hand? To see him obviously framed Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land Where justice is a game.  Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell An innocent man in a living hell. Yes, that's the story of the Hurricane, But it won't be over till they clear his name And give him back the time he's done. Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been The champion of the world.;Bob Dylan;Hurricane

harsh,manic,paranoid;Within striking distance from Ground Zero sits a smoldering international cauldron, the United "Abominations" as it were. Born to prevent wars, it froze in the face of disaster, and stood silent while terrorization took hostage the world.  In a mire of hypocrisy, ignores sex crimes by its blue helmets, and enables terrorism, so in the end, it has failed. And the UN is where our so-called friends get to stab us in the back, and we pay 22% of their tab to host our enemies here at home.  Ambassadors from countries otherwise known as "The Catastrophe" enjoy Diplomatic immunity, living in Manhattan, while their children are turned into prostitutes. It's a complete and utter disgrace! A blot on the face of humanity! And they get away with it!?!  Poverty in their kitchens Held hostage by oil-for-food Yet their own plates are full off the fat of their lands There's no blood on their hands, right Gojo? They promised to tell the truth Without leaving a fingerprint. They will lose the UN one way or another. The victim, I fear will be us, sisters and brothers!  The UN is right you can't be any more "un" Than you are right now, the UN is undone. Another mushroom cloud, another smoking gun. The threat is real, the Locust King has come. Don't tell me the truth I don't like what they've done. It's payback time, at the United Abominations.  A grave and gathering danger The decision to attack Based on secret intelligence, it'll take years I fear to undo the failings in Iraq. You may bury the bodies But you can't bury the crimes. Only fools stand up and really lay down their arms No, not me, not when Death lasts forever  The UN is right you can't be any more "un" Than you are right now, the UN is undone. Another mushroom cloud, another smoking gun. The threat is real, the Locust King has come. Don't tell me the truth I don't like what they've done. It's payback time.  (Foriegn speakers talking)  The UN is right you can't be any more "un" Than you are right now, the UN is undone. Another mushroom cloud, another smoking gun. The threat is real, the Locust King has come.  The UN is right you can't be any more "un" Than you are right now, the UN is undone. Another mushroom cloud, another smoking gun. The threat is real, the Locust King has come. Don't tell me the truth I don't like what they've done. It's payback time, at the United Abominations.  NATO invaded Yugoslavia to end ethnic cleansing, there was no UN. The US invaded Afghanistan after 9/11, there was no UN. Saddam Hussein violated 17 UN resolutions The UN was asked to join the war in Iraq. The US invaded, there was no UN. Libya bombed a discotheque in Berlin killing Americans, there was no UN. Iran funds a mosque, and attacked the US in the seventies, there was no UN. Facing war, without end, looking into the future. There...was...no...more...UN!

Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boilin' fat Food was flying everywhere, I left without my hat  Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank To get some bail for Arab and all the boys back in the tank They asked me for some collateral, and I pulled down my pants They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France Who invited me to her house.

He said, "You're not Him Get out of here before I break your bones, I ain't your pop" I decided to have him arrested and I went looking for a cop  I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab I went out the other door, this Englishman said, "Fab" As he saw me leap a hot dog stand and a chariot that stood Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood I ran right through the front door like a hobo sailor does But it was just a funeral parlor, and the man asked me who I was  I repeated that my friends were all in jail, with a sigh He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die" I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet A pay phone was ringing and it just about blew my mind When I picked it up and said hello, this foot came through the line  Well, by this time I was fed up at tryin' to make a stab At bringin' back any help for my friends and Captain Arab I decided to flip a coin like either heads or tails Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail So I hocked my sailor suit and I got a coin to flip It came up tails, it rhymed with sails, so I made it back to the ship  Well, I got back and took the parkin' ticket off the mast I was ripping it to shreds when this Coast Guard boat went past They asked me my name and I said, "Captain Kidd" They believed me but they wanted to know what exactly that I did I said for the Pope of Eruke I was employed They let me go right away, they were very paranoid  Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail But the funniest thing was when I was leavin' the bay I saw three ships a-sailin', they were all heading my way I asked the captain what his name was and how come he didn't drive a truck He said his name was Columbus.

hypnotic,messy;I married Isis on the fifth day of May, But I could not hold on to her very long. So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away For the wild unknown country where I could not go wrong.  I came to a high place of darkness and light. The dividing line ran through the center of town. I hitched up my pony to a post on the right, Went in to the laundry to wash my clothes down.  A man in the corner approached me for a match. I knew right away he was not ordinary. He said, "Are you lookin' for somethin' easy to catch?" I said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."  We set out that night for the cold in the North. I gave him my blanket, and he gave me his word. I said, "Where are we goin'?" He said we'd be back by the fourth. I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."  I was thinkin' about turquoise, I was thinkin' about gold, I was thinkin' about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace. As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold, I was thinkin' about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless.  How she told me that one day we would meet up again, And things would be different the next time we wed, If I only could hang on and just be her friend. I still can't remember all the best things she said.  We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice. He said, "There's a body I'm tryin' to find. If I carry it out it'll bring a good price." 'Twas-a then that I knew what he had on his mind.  The wind it was howlin' and the snow was outrageous. We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn. When he died I was hopin' that it wasn't contagious, But I made up my mind that I had to go on.  I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty. There was no jewels, no nothin', I felt I'd been had. When I saw that my partner was just bein' friendly, When I took up his offer I must-a been mad.  I picked up his body and I dragged him inside, Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover. I said a quick prayer then I felt satisfied. Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.  She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise. Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed, I came in from the East with the sun in my eyes. I cursed her one time then I rode on ahead.  She said, "Where ya been?" I said, "No place special." She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess." She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."  She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes."  Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child. What drives me to you is what drives me insane. I still can remember the way that you smiled On the fifth day of May in the drizzlin' rain.;Bob Dylan;Isis

For you it's just a memory but for me it still lives on  Bruises fade, father, but the pain remains the same And I still remember how you kept me so, so afraid The strength is my mother for all the love she gave Every morning that I wake, I look back at yesterday  It's not so easy to forget, all the marks you left along her neck When I was thrown against cold stairs And every day afraid to come home in fear of what I might see next  Bruises fade, father, but the pain remains the same And I still remember how you kept me so afraid The strength is my mother for all the love you gave And every morning that I wake, I look back on yesterday And I'm okay I'm okay;Christina Aguilera;I'm OK

indulgent;Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion Always on the outside of whatever side there was When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."  Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last. They called Joe "Crazy," the baby they called "Kid Blast." Some say they lived off gambling and runnin' numbers too. It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue.  Joey, Joey, King of the streets, child of clay. Joey, Joey, What made them want to come and blow you away?  There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that No one ever knew for sure where they were really at. When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost hit the roof. He went out that night to seek revenge, thinkin' he was bulletproof.  The war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners. They stashed them away in a basement, called them amateurs.  The hostages were tremblin' when they heard a man exclaim, "Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame." But Joey stepped up, he raised his hand, said, "We're not those kind of men. It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."  Joey, Joey, King of the streets, child of clay. Joey, Joey, What made them want to come and blow you away?  The police department hounded him, they called him Mr. Smith They got him on conspiracy, they were never sure who with. "What time is it?" said the judge to Joey when they met "Five to ten," said Joey. The judge says, "That's exactly what you get."  He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich They threw him in the hole one time for tryin' to stop a strike. His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand What it's like to be in society with a shackle on your hand.  When they let him out in '71 he'd lost a little weight But he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great. He tried to find the way back into the life he left behind To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."  Joey, Joey, King of the streets, child of clay. Joey, Joey, Why did they have to come and blow you away?  It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun "I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one." Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong deadly foe, Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."  One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York He could see it comin' through the door as he lifted up his fork. He pushed the table over to protect his family Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy.  Joey, Joey, King of the streets, child of clay. Joey, Joey, What made them want to come and blow you away?  Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep. I heard his best friend Frankie say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep." Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save.  The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned They said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born. And someday if God's in heaven overlookin' His preserve I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.  Joey, Joey, King of the streets, child of clay.

intense,volatile;Let me tell you a story to chill the bones, Out of things that I saw. One night wandering in the everglades, I'd one drink but no more.  I was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight,  Gazing up at the stars.  Not aware of a presence so near to me,  Watching my every move.   Feeling scared and I fell to my knees,  As something rushed me from the trees.  Took me to an unholy place,  And that is where I fell from grace.   Then they summoned me over to join in with them  To the dance of the dead.  Into the circle of fire I followed them,  Into the middle I was led.   As if time had stopped still I was numb with fear,  But still I wanted to go.  And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me,  As I walked onto the coals.   And I felt I was in a trance,  And my spirit was lifted from me.  And if only someone had the chance  To witness what happened to me.   And I danced and I pranced and I sang with them,  All had death in their eyes.  Lifeless figures, they were undead all of them,  They had ascended from hell.   As I danced with the dead,  My free spirit was laughing and howling down at me.  Below my undead body just danced the circle of dead.   Until the time came to reunite us both,  My spirit came back down to me.  I didn't know if I was alive or dead,  As the others all joined in with me.   By luck then a skirmish started,  And took the attention away from me.  When they took their gaze from me,  Was the moment that I fled.   I ran like hell faster than the wind  But behind I did not glance.  One thing that I did not dare, Was to look just straight ahead.   When you know that your time has come around,  You know you'll be prepared for it.  Say your last goodbyes to everyone,  Drink and say a prayer for it.   When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed,  And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead.  When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed,  And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead.   To this day I guess I'll never know,  Just why they let me go.  But I'll never go dancing no more,  'Til I dance with the dead.;Iron Maiden;Dance of Death
intense,provocative,volatile;Can't understand what is happening to me This isn't real this is only a dream But I never have felt, no I never have felt this way before  I'm looking down on my body below I lie asleep in the midst of a dream Is it now could it be the Angel of death has come for me?

Maybe I'm going down there as well I can't accept my soul will drift forever  Feel myself floating back down to earth So could this be the hour of my rebirth Or have I died or will I wake from dreaming?

literate,lush,summery;Sixteen years, Sixteen banners united over the field Where the good shepherd grieves. Desperate men, desperate women divided, Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves.  Fortune calls. I stepped forth from the shadows, to the marketplace, Merchants and thieves, hungry for power, my last deal gone down. She's smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born, On midsummer's eve, near the tower.  The cold-blooded moon. The captain waits above the celebration Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid Whose ebony face is beyond communication. The captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid.  They shaved her head. She was torn between Jupiter and Apollo. A messenger arrived with a black nightingale. I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow, Follow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil.  I stumbled to my feet. I rode past destruction in the ditches With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo. Renegade priests and treacherous young witches Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.  The palace of mirrors Where dog soldiers are reflected, The endless road and the wailing of chimes, The empty rooms where her memory is protected, Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times.  She wakes him up Forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking Near broken chains, mountain laurel and rolling rocks. She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking.

I'm with you once more under the stars, And down by the shore an orchestra's playing And even the palms seem to be swaying When they begin the beguine. To live it again is past all endeavor, Except when that tune clutches my heart, And there we are, swearing to love forever, And promising never, never to part. What moments divine, what rapture serene, Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted, And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted, I know but too well what they mean So don't let them begin the beguine Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember When they begin the beguine. Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play Till the stars that were there before return above you, Till you whisper to me once more, Darling, I love you! And we suddenly know What heaven we're in, When they begin the beguine;Ella Fitzgerald;Begin the Beguine

You know I'll aways love you and I can't forget the day when you were mine.  Forgiving you was easy but forgetting seems to take the longest time.  The bitter fruit of anger growing from the seeds of jealousy. Oh what a heart ache but I forgive the things you said to me. For I believe forgiving is the only way I'll find peace of mind.  Forgiving you was easy but forgeting seems to take the longest time.  The years have past so quickly, As once again they've sealed a young man's dream of all the golden years  And growing old together you and me.  You ask me to forgive you.

pastoral;What a beautiful thought I am thinking Concerning a great speckled bird Remember her name is recorded On the pages of God's Holy Word.  All the other birds are flocking 'round her And she is despised by the squad But the great speckled bird in the Bible Is one with the great church of God.  All the other churches are against her They envy her glory and fame They hate her because she is chosen And has not denied Jesus' name.  Desiring to lower her standard They watch every move that she makes They long to find fault with her teachings But really they find no mistake.  She is spreading her wings for a journey She's going to leave by and by When the trumpet shall sound in the morning She'll rise and go up in the sky.  In the presence of all her despisers With a song never uttered before She will rise and be gone in a moment Till the great tribulation is o'er.  I am glad I have learned of her meekness I am proud that my name is on her book For I want to be one never fearing The face of my Savior to look.  When He cometh descending from heaven On the cloud that He writes in His Word I'll be joyfully carried to meet Him On the wings of that great speckled bird.;Johnny Cash;Great Speckled Bird

Then I fumbled in my closet through my clothes And found my cleanest dirty shirt. Then I washed my face and combed my hair And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day.  I'd smoked my mind the night before With cigarettes and the songs I'd been pickin' But I lit my first and watched a small kid Playin' with a can that he was kicking Then I walked across the street And caught the Sunday smell of someone's fryin' chicken And it took me back to somethin' That I'd lost somewhere, somehow along the way.  On a Sunday morning sidewalk I'm wishing Lord that I was stoned 'Cause there's something in a Sunday That makes a body feel alone. And there's nothin' short of dyin' That's half as lonesome as the sound Of a sleepin' city sidewalk And Sunday mornin' comin' down.  In the park I saw a daddy With a laughin' little girl who he was swingin' And I stopped beside a Sunday school And listened to the songs they were singin' Then I headed down the street And somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringin' And it echoed thru the canyon  Like the disappearing dreams of yesterday.  On a Sunday morning sidewalk I'm wishing Lord that I was stoned 'Cause there's something in a Sunday That makes a body feel alone.

reverent;I could tell the moment that I saw Him He was nothing but the troublemaking kind His hair was much too long Aand His motley group of friends  Had nothing but rebellion on their minds.  He's rejected the establishment completely  And I know for sure He's never held a job. He just goes from town to town Stirring up the young folks 'Til they're nothing but a disrespectful mob.  And I know for sure He's never joined the army  And served His country like we all have done.  He'd rather wear His sandals and His flowers  While others wage the war that must be won.  They arrested Him last week and found Him guilty Aand sentenced Him to die but that's no great loss. Friday they will take Him to a place called Calvary  And hang that troublemaker to a cross.

And she bragged about her son with his uniform and gun, And these things you called a good old-fashioned war.  Oh! Good old-fashioned war!  Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come. They ceased to come for about ten months or more. Then a letter finally came saying, "Go down and meet the train. Your son's a-coming home from the war."  She smiled and went right down, she looked everywhere around But she could not see her soldier son in sight. But as all the people passed, she saw her son at last, When she did she could hardly believe her eyes.  Oh his face was all shot up and his hand was all blown off And he wore a metal brace around his waist. He whispered kind of slow, in a voice she did not know, While she couldn't even recognize his face!  Oh! Lord! Not even recognize his face.  "Oh tell me, my darling son, pray tell me what they done. How is it you come to be this way?" He tried his best to talk but his mouth could hardly move And the mother had to turn her face away.  "Don't you remember, Ma, when I went off to war You thought it was the best thing I could do? I was on the battleground, you were home . . . acting proud. You wasn't there standing in my shoes."  "Oh, and I thought when I was there, God, what am I doing here?  I'm a-tryin' to kill somebody or die tryin'. But the thing that scared me most was when my enemy came close And I saw that his face looked just like mine."  Oh! Lord! Just like mine!  "And I couldn't help but think, through the thunder rolling and stink, That I was just a puppet in a play. And through the roar and smoke, this string is finally broke, And a cannon ball blew my eyes away."  As he turned away to walk, his Ma was still in shock  At seein' the metal brace that helped him stand. But as he turned to go, he called his mother close And he dropped his medals down into her hand.;Bob Dylan;John Brown

I dreamed about my mother, Dear old papa, sister and brother, I dreamed about the girl Who's been waiting for so long.  I wanna go home, I wanna go home, Oh, how I wanna go home!  Home, folks think I'm big in Detroit City, From the letters that I write, they think I'm fine. But by day, I make the cars, And by night, I make the bars, If only they could read between the lines!  You know, I rode a freight train north to Detroit City, After all these years, I find that I've just been wastin' my time. So I think I'll take my foolish pride, Put on a south bound freight and ride,  Goin' back to the love ones, The ones I left waitin' so far behind. I wanna go home, I wanna go home Oh, how  want to go home.;Tom Jones;Detroit City

soft-quiet;Morningside, the old man died. And no one cried, they simply turned away. And when he died, He left a table made of nails and pride. And with his hands he carved these words inside: "For my children"  Morning light, morning bright. I spent the night with dreams that make you weep. Morning time, Wash away the sadness from these eyes of mine, For I recall the words an old man signed: "For my children"  And the legs were shaped with his hands, And the top made of oaken wood. And the children that sat around this great table, Touched it with their laughter, and that was good.  Morningside, the old man died. And no one cried, he surely died alone. And truth is sad, For not a child would claim the gift he had. The words he carved became his epitaph... "For my children";Neil Diamond;Morningside

She heads up the Canadian Rockies where the rippling waters glide, Comes a-roaring down the canyon to meet the salty tide, Of the wide Pacific Ocean where the sun sets in the West And the big Grand Coulee country in the land I love the best.  In the misty crystal glitter of that wild and wind ward spray, Men have fought the pounding waters and met a watery grave, Well, she tore their boats to splinters but she gave men dreams to dream Of the day the Coulee Dam would cross that wild and wasted stream.  Uncle Sam took up the challenge in the year of 'thrity-three, For the farmer and the factory and all of you and me, He said, "Roll along, Columbia, you can ramble to the sea, But river, while you're rambling, you can do some work for me."  Now in Washington and Oregon you can hear the factories hum, Making chrome and making manganese and light aluminum, And there roars the flying fortress now to fight for Uncle Sam, Spawned upon the King Columbia by the big Grand Coulee Dam.;Woody Guthrie;The Grand Coulee Dam

sprawling;Well, there was this movie I seen one time, About a man riding 'cross the desert and it starred Gregory Peck. He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself. The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck.  Well, the marshal, now he beat that kid to a bloody pulp as the dying gunfighter lay in the sun and gasped for his last breath. Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square, I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death.  Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in And you know it blows right through me like a ball and chain. You know I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart. The memory of you keeps callin' after me like a rollin' train.  I can still see the day that you came to me on the painted desert In your busted down Ford and your platform heels I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet Ah, but you were right. It was perfect as I got in behind the wheel.  Well, we drove that car all night into San Anton' And we slept near the Alamo, your skin was so tender and soft. Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back. I would have gone on after you but I didn't feel like letting my head get blown off.  Well, we're drivin' this car and the sun is comin' up over the Rockies, Now I know she ain't you but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul. But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore to remember the times when I was your only man And she don't want to remind me. She knows this car would go out of control.  Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls, teeth like pearls shining like the moon above Brownsville girl, show me all around the world, Brownsville girl, you're my honey love.  Well, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live. He owned a wreckin' lot outside of town about a mile. Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back. She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust. She said, "Henry ain't here but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."  Then she told us how times were tough and about how she was thinkin' of bummin' a ride back to where she started. But ya know, she changed the subject every time money came up. She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead." You could tell she was so broken-hearted. She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."  "How far are y'all going?" Ruby asked us with a sigh. "We're going all the way 'til the wheels fall off and burn, 'Til the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies." Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."  Something about that movie though, well I just can't get it out of my head But I can't remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play. All I remember about it was Gregory Peck and the way people moved And a lot of them seemed to be lookin' my way.  Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls, teeth like pearls shining like the moon above Brownsville girl, show me all around the world, Brownsville girl, you're my honey love.  Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour. I was crossin' the street when shots rang out. I didn't know whether to duck or to run, so I ran. "We got him cornered in the churchyard," I heard somebody shout.  Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune. Underneath it, it said, "A man with no alibi." You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you. Then when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears, It was the best acting I saw anybody do.  Now I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass but sometimes you just find yourself over the line. Oh if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now. You know, I feel pretty good, but that ain't sayin' much. I could feel a whole lot better, If you were just here by my side to show me how.  Well, I'm standin' in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck, Yeah, but you know it's not the one that I had in mind. He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about But I'll see him in anything so I'll stand in line.  Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls, teeth like pearls shining like the moon above Brownsville girl, show me all around the world, Brownsville girl, you're my honey love.  You know, it's funny how things never turn out the way you had 'em planned. The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter is that his name wasn't Henry Porter. And you know there was somethin' about you baby that I liked that was always too good for this world Just like you always said there was something about me you liked that I left behind in the French Quarter.  Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections than people who are most content. I don't have any regrets, they can talk about me plenty when I'm gone. You always said people don't do what they believe in, they just do what's most convenient, then they repent. And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."  There was a movie I seen one time, I think I sat through it twice. I don't remember who I was or where I was bound. All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck, he wore a gun and he was shot in the back. Seems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down.

sprawling;The festival was over, the boys were all plannin' for a fall, The cabaret was quiet except for the drillin' in the wall. The curfew had been lifted and the gamblin' wheel shut down, Anyone who had any sense had already left town. He was standin' in the doorway lookin' like the Jack of Hearts.  He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said, Then everyone commenced to do what they were doin' before he turned their heads.  Then he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin, "Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?" Then he moved into the corner, face down like the Jack of Hearts.  Backstage the girls were playin' five-card stud by the stairs, Lily had two queens, she was hopin' for a third to match her pair. Outside the streets were fillin' up, the window was open wide, A gentle breeze was blowin', you could feel it from inside. Lily called another bet and drew up the Jack of Hearts.  Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine, He made his usual entrance lookin' so dandy and so fine. With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place, He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste. But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the Jack of Hearts.  Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town, She slipped in through the side door lookin' like a queen without a crown. She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear, "Sorry, darlin', that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear. He was starin' into space over at the Jack of Hearts.  "I know I've seen that face somewhere," Big Jim was thinkin' to himself, "Maybe down in Mexico or a picture up on somebody's shelf." But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights did dim And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him, Starin' at the butterfly who just drew the Jack of Hearts.  Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child, She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled.  She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs With men in every walk of life which took her everywhere. But she'd never met anyone quite like the Jack of Hearts.  The hangin' judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined, The drillin' in the wall kept up but no one seemed to pay it any mind. It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king. No, nothin' ever would except maybe the Jack of Hearts.  Rosemary started drinkin' hard and seein' her reflection in the knife, She was tired of the attention, tired of playin' the role of Big Jim's wife. She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide, Was lookin' to do just one good deed before she died. She was gazin' to the future, riding on the Jack of Hearts.  Lily took her dress off and buried it away. "Has your luck run out?" she laughed at him, "Well, I guess you must have known it would someday. Be careful not to touch the wall, there's a brand-new coat of paint, I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're lookin' like a saint." Down the hallway footsteps were comin' for the Jack of Hearts.  The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair. "There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air." He went to get the hangin' judge, but the hangin' judge was drunk, As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk. There was no actor anywhere better than the Jack of Hearts.  No one knew the circumstance but they say that it happened pretty quick, The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked. And Big Jim was standin' there, ya couldn't say surprised, Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes. She was with Big Jim but she was leanin' to the Jack of Hearts.  Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall And cleaned out the bank safe, it's said they got off with quite a haul. In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground For one more member who had business back in town. But they couldn't go no further without the Jack of Hearts.  The next day was hangin' day, the sky was overcast and black, Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back. And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink, The hangin' judge was sober, he hadn't had a drink. The only person on the scene missin' was the Jack of Hearts.  The cabaret was empty now, a sign said, "Closed for repair," Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair. She was thinkin' 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw, Thinkin' 'bout Rosemary and thinkin' about the law. But, most of all she was thinkin' 'bout the Jack of Hearts.;Bob Dylan;Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts

stately;Well, there's many a strange impulse out on the plains of West Texas. There's many a young boy who feels things he can't comprehend. And a small town don't like it when somebody falls between sexes. No, a small town don't like it when a cowboy has feelings for men.  And I believe to my soul that inside every man there's the feminine. And inside every lady there's a deep manly voice loud and clear. Well, a cowboy may brag about things that he's done with his women. But the ones who brag loudest are the ones that are most likely queer.  Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other. Say, what do you think all them saddles and boots was about? And there's many a cowboy who don't understand the way that he feels for his brother. And inside every cowboy there's a lady that'd love to slip out.  And there's always somebody who says what the others just whisper. And mostly that someone's the first one to get shot down dead. So when you talk to a cowboy don't treat him like he was a sister. You can't fuck with a lady that's sleepin' in each cowboy's head.  Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other. What did you think all them saddles and boots was about? And there's many a cowboy who don't understand the way that he feels for his brother.

stately;Another night with open eyes Too late to sleep, too soon to rise You're short of breath, is it a heart attack? Hot and feverish you face the fact  You're in love, and it feels like shame Because she's gone and made a fool of you in public again You're in love, and it feels like pain Because you know there's too much truth in everything she claims  So ask yourself now: Can you forgive her If she wants you to? Ask yourself: Can you even deliver What she demands of you?  You drift into the strangest dreams Of youthful follies and changing teams Admit you're wrong, oh, no, not yet Then you wake up and remember that you can't forget  She's made you some kind of laughing stock Because you dance to disco, and you don't like rock She'd make fun of you, and even in bed Said she was gonna go and get herself a real man instead  So ask yourself now: Can you forgive her If she begs you to? Ask yourself: Can you even deliver What she demands of you? Or do you want revenge? But that's childish, so childish! (But that's childish, so childish!)  Remember when you were more easily led Behind the cricket pavilion and the bicycle shed Trembling as your dreams came true You looked right into those blue eyes and knew  It was love, and now you can't pretend You've forgotten all the promises of that first friend It's bad enough, she knows how you feel But she's not prepared to share you with the memory  So ask yourself now: Can you forgive her If she begs you to? Ask yourself: Can you even deliver What she demands of you? Ask yourself now: Can you forgive her If she begs you to? And ask yourself: Can you even deliver What she demands of you? Or do you want revenge? But that's childish, so childish!;Pet Shop Boys;Can You Forgive Her?
stately;Well the dawn was coming, Heard him ringing on my bell. He said, My name's the teacher, That is what I call myself. And I have a lesson That I must impart to you. It's an old expression But I must insist it's true.  Jump up, look around, Find yourself some fun, No sense in sitting there hating everyone. No man's an island and his castle isn't home, The nest is full of nothing when the bird has flown.  So I took a journey, Threw my world into the sea. With me went the teacher Who found fun instead of me.  Hey man, what's the plan, what was that you said? Sun-tanned, drink in hand, lying there in bed. I try to socialize but I can't seem to find What I was looking for, got something on my mind.  Then the teacher told me It had been a lot of fun. Thanked me for his ticket And all that I had done.

whimsical,witty,wry;One time ago a crazy dream came to me I dreamt I was walkin' into World War III Went to the doctor the very next day To see what kinda words he could say, said it was a bad dream "I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though, them old dreams are only in your head"  I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain" He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane" He grabbed my arm, I said, "Ouch" As I landed on the psychiatric couch, said, "Tell me about it"  Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast It was all over by quarter past I was down in the sewer with some little lover When I peeked out from a manhole cover Wonderin' who turned the lights on us  Well, I got up and walked around Up and down the lonesome town I stood a-wondering which way to go I lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road It was a normal day  Well, I rung me a fallout shelter bell And I leaned my head and I give a yell "Gimme a string bean, I'm a hungry man" A shotgun fired and away I ran I don't blame them too much though, they didn't know me  Down the corner by the hot-dog stand, I seen a man I said, "Howdy friend, I guess it's just us two" He screamed a bit and away he flew Thought I was a communist  Well I spied a girl and before she could leave I said, "Let's go and play Adam and Eve" I took her by the hand and my heart it was thumpin' She said, "Hey man, you crazy or somethin'? You see what happened last time they started"  Well, I seen a Cadillac window uptown There was nobody around I got into the driver's seat And I drove 42nd Street in my Cadillac Good car to drive after a war  Well, I remember seein' some ad So I turned on my Conelrad But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill So the radio didn't work so well  Turned on my record-player It was "Rock-A-Day Johnny," singing "Tell Your Ma, Tell Your Pa Our Love's a-Gonna Grow Ooh-wah, Ooh-wah"  I was feelin' kinda lonesome and blue And I needed somebody to talk to So I called up the operator of time Just to hear a voice of some kind "When you hear the beep, it will be three o'clock" She said that for over an hour and I hung up  Well the doctor interrupted me just about then Sayin', "Hey, I've been havin' the same old dreams But mine was a little different, you see I dreamt that the only person left after the war was me I didn't see you around"  Well, now time passed and now it seems everybody's having them dreams Everybody sees theirself Walkin' around with no one else Half of the people can be part-right all of the time Some of the people can be all right part of the time But all the people can't be all right all the time I think Abraham Lincoln said that "I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours," I said that;Bob Dylan;Talkin' World War III Blues
wintry;Procession moves on, the shouting is over Praise to the glory of loved ones now gone Talking aloud as they sit round their tables Scattering flowers washed down by the rain  Stood by the gate at the foot of the garden Watching them pass like clouds in the sky Try to cry out in the heat of the moment Possessed by a fury that burns from inside  Cry like a child, though these years make me older With children, my time is so wastefully spent A burden to keep, though their inner communion I accept like a curse an unlucky deal  Played by the gate at the foot of the garden My view stretches out from the fence to the wall No words could explain, no actions determine Just watching the trees and the leaves as they fall;Joy Division;The Eternal

wintry;I believe that you heard your master sing When I was sick in bed. I suppose that he told you everything That I keep locked away in my head. Your master took you travelling, Well at least that's what you said. And now do you come back to bring Your prisoner wine and bread?  You met him at some temple, where They take your clothes at the door. He was just a numberless man in a chair Who'd just come back from the war. And you wrap up his tired face in your hair And he hands you the apple core. Then he touches your lips now so suddenly bare Of all the kisses we put on some time before.  And he gave you a German Shepherd to walk With a collar of leather and nails, And he never once made you explain or talk About all of the little details, Such as who had a word and who had a rock, And who had you through the mails. Now your love is a secret all over the block, And it never stops not even when your master fails.  And he took you up in his aeroplane, Which he flew without any hands, And you cruised above the ribbons of rain That drove the crowd from the stands. Then he killed the lights in a lonely Lane And, an ape with angel glands, Erased the final wisps of pain With the music of rubber bands.  And now I hear your master sing, You kneel for him to come. His body is a golden string That your body is hanging from. His body is a golden string, My body has grown numb. Oh now you hear your master sing, Your shirt is all undone.  And will you kneel beside this bed That we polished so long ago, Before your master chose instead To make my bed of snow? Your eyes are wild and your knuckles are red And you're speaking far too low. No I can't make out what your master said Before he made you go.  Then I think you're playing far too rough For a lady who's been to the moon I've lain by this window long enough To get used to an empty room. And your love is some dust in an old man's cough Who is tapping his foot to a tune, And your thighs are a ruin, you want too much, Let's say you came back some time too soon.  I loved your master perfectly I taught him all that he knew. He was starving in some deep mystery Like a man who is sure what is true. And I sent you to him with my guarantee I could teach him something new, And I taught him how you would long for me No matter what he said no matter what you'd do.  I believe that you heard your master sing While I was sick in bed, I'm sure that he told you everything I must keep locked away in my head. Your master took you travelling, Well at least that's what you said, And now do you come back to bring Your prisoner wine and bread?;Leonard Cohen;Master Song
wintry;Oh, I miss the kiss of treachery The shameless kiss of vanity The soft and the black and the velvety Up tight against the side of me And mouth and eyes and heart all bleed And run in thickening streams of greed As bit by bit, it starts the need To just let go, my party piece  Oh, I miss the kiss of treachery The aching kiss before I feed The stench of a love for younger meat And the sound it makes when it cuts in deep The holding up on bended knees The addiction of duplicities As bit by bit, it starts the need To just let go, my party piece  I never said I would stay to the end So I leave you with babies and hoping for frequency Screaming like this in the hope of the secrecy Screaming me over and over and over I leave you with photographs, pictures of trickery Stains on the carpet and stains on the scenery Songs about happiness, murmured in dreams And we both of us knew how the ending would be  So it's all come back round to breaking apart again Breaking apart like I'm made up of glass again Making it up behind my back again Holding my breath for the fear of sleep again Holding it up behind my head again Cut in deep, to the heart of bone again Round and round and round It's coming apart again Over and over and over  Now that I know that I'm breaking to pieces I'll pull out my heart and I'll feed it to anyone Crying for sympathy Crocodiles cry For the love of the crowd and three cheers from everyone Dropping through sky Through the glass of the roof Through the roof of your mouth Through the mouth of your eye Through the eye of the needle It's easier for me To get closer to Heaven than ever feel whole again  I never said I would stay to the end I knew I would leave you with babies and everything Screaming like this in the hole of sincerity Screaming me over and over and over I leave you with photographs, pictures of trickery And stains on the carpet and stains on the memory Songs about happiness, murmured in dreams And we both of us knew how the end always is How the end always is  How the end always is How the end always is How the end always is How the end always is Always Always;The Cure;Disintegration

witty;Oh, they say some people long ago Were searching for a diff'rent tune One that they could croon As only they can They only had the rhythm So they started swaying to and fro They didn't know just what to use That is how the blues really began They heard the breeze in the trees Singing weird melodies And they made that the start of the blues  And from a jail came the wail Of a down-hearted frail And they played that As part of the blues From a whippoorwill Out on a hill They took a new note Pushed it through a horn 'Til it was worn Into a blue note And then they nursed it, rehearsed it And gave out the news That the Southland gave birth to the blues!;Frank Sinatra;The Birth of the Blues

witty;Oh,... they say my people long ago. Where lookin' for a different tune. One that we can croon As only we can. We only had the rhythm. So, we started swingin' to and fro. We didn't know just what to use. But this is how the blues. I said the blues really began. Ohhh yeah.  We..heard... the breeze. Through the trees. Singing weird melodies. And we named that the start of the blues.  Then from a jail. There came a whale. From a down-hearted frail. And we played that. To be a part of our blues.  From a whippoorwill High on a hill. They took a new note. Pushed it through a horn. Till it was worn into a blue note.  You better believed me we nursed it. And we rehearsed it. Than we gave out the news. That the South Land, gave birth to the Blues.;Sammy Davis, Jr.;Birth of the Blues
